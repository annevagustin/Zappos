			<h3>How to Care for a Llama</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Give your llama a good shelter. It should be 

at least three sided with a high roof for ventilation.</li>
				<li>Feed your llama. Read more <a 

href="http://www.wikihow.com/Care-for-a-Llama" title="WikiHow.com: How to Care 

for a Llama">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Like a horse, give your llama ground mineral 

salt (llama's can not lick like a cow or horse so a block won't work) in his/her 

stable which s/he can access whenever needed.</li>
				<li>Have a suitable fence for your llama. The 

best kind of fencing to use is corral fencing, do not use cheap picket fencing, 

rotted fencing, or barbed wire fencing.</li>
				<li>Make sure that there is nothing dangerous in 

the shelter and pasture area, such as broken glass, or poisonous plants.</li>
				<li>Get your llama sheared at least once a year 

as to keep them cool and their wool clean.</li>
				<li>Llama feet are very sensitive, and have 

nails which need to be clipped. If you do not know how to clip your llamas feet, 

hire a professional as trying on your own with no experience can hurt your 

llama.</li>
