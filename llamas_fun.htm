				<p>In this animated comedy from the folks at 

Disney, the vain and cocky <strong>Emperor Kuzco</strong> is a very busy man. 

Besides maintaining his "groove", and firing his suspicious administrator, Yzma; 

he's also planning to build a new waterpark just for himself for his birthday. 

However, this means destroying one of the villages in his kingdom. Meanwhile, 

Yzma is hatching a plan to get revenge and usurp the throne. But, in a botched 

assassination courtesy of Yzma's right-hand man, Kronk, Kuzco is magically 

transformed into a llama. Now, Kuzco finds himself the property of Pacha, a 

lowly llama herder whose home is ground zero for the water park. Upon 

discovering the llama's true self, Pacha offers to help resolve the Emperor's 

problem and regain his throne, only if he promises to move his water park.</p>

			<p><strong>Night of Drinking</strong>
			<br />A man and his pet llama walk into a bar. It's 

about 5pm, but they're ready for a good night of drinking. They start off 

slowly, watching TV, drinking beer, eating peanuts. As the night goes on they 

move to mixed drinks, and then shooters, one after the other. Finally, the 

bartender says: "Last call." So, the man says, "One more for me... and one more 

for my llama." The bartender sets them up and they shoot them back. Suddenly, 

the llama falls over dead. The man throws some money on the bar, puts on his 

coat and starts to leave. The bartender, yells: "Hey buddy, you can't just leave 

that lyin' there." To which the man replies: "That's not a lion, that's a 

llama."</p>
			<p><strong>Front Seat</strong>
			<br />A policeman in the big city stops a man in a car 

with a llama in the front seat. "What are you doing with that llama?" He 

exclaimed, "You should take it to the zoo." The following week, the same 

policeman sees the same man with the llama again in the front seat, with both of 

them wearing sunglasses. The policeman pulls him over. "I thought you were going 

to take that llama to the zoo!" The man replied, "I did. We had such a good time 

we are going to the beach this weekend!"</p>
